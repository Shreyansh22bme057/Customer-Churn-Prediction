## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn vs non-churn behavior, feature distributions, and correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created meaningful features to boost model learning capability.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained multiple ML models and compared based on accuracy, recall, and precision.

5. **Insights & Conclusion**  
   - Identified key drivers of churn such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
